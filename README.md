### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting my **Master's degree in Computer Science** with a focus on **Data Analytics** from the **University of Houston**.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I can, but specifically, Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Big Data Analytics, amongst others...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that piques my interest.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything tech related
- âš¡ Fun fact: The Firefox logo isn't a foxâ€¦ it's a red panda!
