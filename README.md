### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting my **Masters degree in Computer Science** with a focus on **Data Analytics** from **University of Houston**.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I can, but specifically, Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Big Data Analytics, amongst others...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that piques my interest.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything tech related
